# HACKPHASIA
An intelligent and energy-efficient HVAC solution designed to revolutionize climate control in buildings. This project leverages AI and IoT to enhance comfort, reduce energy consumption, and promote sustainability.
ðŸš€ Features

1. Smart HVAC Control
Dynamic Adjustment: AI models like reinforcement learning adjust temperature, airflow, and mode based on real-time conditions such as occupancy, indoor temperature, and weather.
Personalized Comfort: The system adapts to user preferences, ensuring optimal comfort while minimizing energy usage.
2. Predictive Maintenance
AI monitors sensor data (vibrations, energy spikes, temperature anomalies) to predict HVAC component failures.
Reduces downtime and prevents energy wastage from inefficient operations.
3. Zone-Specific Optimization
Divides the building into zones, independently controlling HVAC operations for each zone.
Automatically shuts off HVAC in unoccupied areas to conserve energy.
4. Energy Recovery and Efficiency Upgrades
Integrates heat recovery systems to recycle waste heat for other processes.
AI maximizes energy efficiency with real-time adjustments.
5. Advanced Insights and Notifications
Dashboards display energy usage trends, cost savings, and carbon footprint reduction.
Real-time alerts for maintenance needs and energy-saving tips.
6. Health and Environment Monitoring
Monitors indoor air quality (CO2, allergens, humidity) and ensures healthy living spaces.
Features a Green Mode for eco-friendly operation.
